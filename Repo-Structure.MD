### Repository Structure

This repo will have a separate branch for each collaborator.  
Each collaborator is required to work independently on their feature with minimal overlap.

**Structure:**\
|--- main  
|--- test  
|--- Pratik  
|--- Sikha  
|--- Bidhi  
|--- Safal  

Each collaborator will have a branch under their name.

There will also be a `test` branch.  
After completing major features or tasks, merge your branch into `test`.  
Later, `test` will be merged into `main`.

Everyone is required to rebase their branch with `test` regularly to keep it updated.

**Rules:**
- No one is allowed to merge their branch directly into `main`.
- All merging should be done into the `test` branch via a proper pull request (PR).
- Open a PR and merge into `test` only after approval.
- Do not merge into `main` or open PRs to `main`.
- Commit frequently and keep rebasing with `test` to stay updated.
