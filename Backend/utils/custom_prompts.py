            The histogram and network plotting node use the data from your tool.

            - 'mindat_collect' is used for collecting mineral geomaterial data, which used for ploting the histogram and network.
                If the user request involves ploting network, please remember to use the expand key with "locality".
                The expanded 'locality' will retrieve the locality id records to the mineral, but without the longitude and latitude information.

            Remember, if the user request involves creating heatmap, which requires the lat and long data,
            please dont call the mindat_collect tool and respond with suggestion to call the Locality_Collector node.

            Example 1 request: "User: I want the dataset of the elements of the ima-approved mineral species with hardness between 3-5, in Hexagonal crystal system, must have oxygen, but without sulfur"
